# MakeGoodGames-TwitterBot
A simple bot to promote indiegame devs within the tweetosphere.

### Support the underdogs!
A Twitter-bot for the under represented indiedevs. It currently looks for new or barely known indie devs and RTs their game updates! I'm looking forward to implement more than just a good RTweeter. For now the target tweets are those that have a *relative* high RT ratio with regards to number of followers (i.e. those tweets with high RT and low user followers are prioritized). 

###Some of the features on the To Do list are:
1) Better mechanism to detect under representation and tweet selection.
2) Tweet daily reports on #indiedev and #indiegame community.

###This a very tailor-made code for my personal use.
If you have any questions dont hesitate to send me a personal message or raise an issue.

Thank you!
